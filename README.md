## UI UX Design
I have designed this ‘mobile first’. The majority of site visitors will likely access the site via a mobile device and we want it to be responsive and looking at its best in this format.

### Navigation
The mobile screen will use the ‘burger’ button with a dropdown menu. The Desktop screen will have a nav bar across the top with these links included.

### Structure
I decided on a design with 4 separate pages.  Home, About, Menu, Contact.


Each page will have the same footer with contact details and links to social media pages.

The home page has an intro, where can we find you etc.. and lots of CTA buttons to take you directly to the relevant sections on the other pages.

The about page has the ‘Who are we’ and ‘What is creole?’ sections. 

The Menu page just has the items listed. My plan is to add some user interaction / animation here. So when hovered on or clicked on the menu expands and further text description / image is displayed. We can also add a PDF download button so they can have the whole menu. 

The Contact page details how to contact and a contact form.
